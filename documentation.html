        Originally, I had planned on only using the Greensock library for this project. The entire first page's extended javascript
        library comes from the Greensock library. This worked because everything that I wanted to do in this page was focused
        more on changing dialogue with vanilla javascript. The Greensock library was used to have the characters in the environment
        emote and essentially show off who was talking. 
        <br>
        <br>
        When I moved onto the second page, I realized that Greensock would probably
        not be the best library to utilize for what I wanted to do. The second page is more focused on movement and timing on
        completed actions. This is something which Greensock would not have worked as smoothly on as Anime.js. I was able to figure
        out to do different animations upon completing one set of actions using Anime.js. The second page's extended javascript comes
        from the Anime.js library. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For the third page I tried to recreate what I did on my second page, except I would use the Greensock library instead of
        Anime.js. Instead of being able to call new animations on the completion of a previous animation, I had things set to a 
        timed delay. I timed the delays so that they would go off to create an effect similar to the complete actions of Anime.js.
        Although it was done in a more clunky that required help from Jquery and vanilla javascript, I think that the timing stil
        looks akin to what was done on the Interactive Map page.

        One thing that I did was that I created my own svg images for my characters and buttons. However, the backgrounds 
        were all taken places on the internet.
